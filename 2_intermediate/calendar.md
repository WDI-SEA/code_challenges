## Historical Background

The [Gregorian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar), which is the calendar currently in use in most of the world, was introduced by Pope Gregory XII in 1582. The main feature is adding a leap year (which is a year with an extra day) roughly every 4 years. This helped account for the fact that the number of days in a year was an even number. In fact, the true amount of days in a year is about 365.2422. Thus, adding an extra day every 4 years helped account for that extra time, which had been causing the previous calendar, the Julian calendar to be offset from the actual seasons.

The Gregorian calendar wasn't widely adopted until a couple centuries later when the British empire began to use it.
