# Code Challenges

In order to keep your coding skills sharp and ace your interviews, it's really important to practice with challenging problems.

## How to Use this Repo

This repository contains both prompts and answers. Please don't share the answers until after the student has completed the challenge.

The challenges are broken up by difficulty level into different folders `beginner`, `intermediate`, `difficult` and `beyond_wdi`. 

### Beginner

These problems are primarily based around the fundamentals of JavaScript and SQL. It is appropriate for the first half of the course or for introductions to topics. The problem should be solvable simply by knowing the language features.

### Intermediate

These problems assume a base knowledge of JavaScript, SQL, and other programming fundamentals. The problem requires some thinking above the language features in order to get to a solution.

### Difficult

These are the most difficult problems a WDI student is expected to attempt within the 12 weeks of the course. Solutions to these problems require knowledge and problem solving well above the language basics, and include topics like binary search, common sorts, and introductory data structures.

### Beyond WDI 

These problems are typically beyond the scope of the course for most students but advanced students may want to attempt them as a challenge while in the course. These problems may cover topics like more advanced data structures, modifications on introductory data structures/algorithms, and more difficult sort implementations.
